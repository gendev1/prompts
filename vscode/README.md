# Quick Setup Guide - Copy & Run Tomorrow

## ðŸš€ 5-Minute Setup

### Step 1: Create Folder Structure

Run this in your project root:

```bash
# Create all folders
mkdir -p anchor patterns .copilot/prompts/{1-anchor-setup,2-patterns-setup,3-daily-workflow,4-work-checkup}

# Create base files
touch anchor/project-anchor.md
touch patterns/patterns-library.md

# Add to .gitignore (if you want to keep these private)
echo "anchor/" >> .gitignore
echo "patterns/" >> .gitignore
echo ".copilot/" >> .gitignore
```

### Step 2: Copy Base Documents

1. **Copy the "Project Anchor Document"** artifact â†’ Save as `anchor/project-anchor.md`
2. **Copy the "Patterns Library"** artifact â†’ Save as `patterns/patterns-library.md`
3. **Copy each prompt section** from "Organized Copilot Prompts" â†’ Save in appropriate folders

### Step 3: First Time Usage

```bash
# Open VSCode in your project
code .

# Open the anchor document
code anchor/project-anchor.md

# Open a prompt file in split view
code .copilot/prompts/1-anchor-setup/analyze-codebase.md
```

## ðŸ“‹ Your First Hour Workflow

### Hour 1: Build Your Anchor (30 mins)

1. **Analyze your codebase** (5 mins)

    - Open any main file
    - Copy prompt from `1-anchor-setup/analyze-codebase.md`
    - Let Copilot analyze

2. **Extract your User types** (10 mins)

    - Open your User model/entity
    - Copy prompt from `1-anchor-setup/extract-types.md`
    - Paste extracted types into `anchor/project-anchor.md`

3. **Extract repository pattern** (5 mins)

    - Open any repository file
    - Use extract prompt
    - Add to anchor document

4. **Extract service pattern** (5 mins)

    - Open any service file
    - Use extract prompt
    - Add to anchor document

5. **Save and commit** (5 mins)
    - Your anchor document is ready!

### Hour 2: Extract First Pattern (30 mins)

1. **Find a repeated pattern** (10 mins)

    - Look for similar code in 2+ files
    - Copy prompt from `2-patterns-setup/extract-patterns.md`

2. **Create reusable version** (10 mins)

    - Let Copilot generate the pattern
    - Add to `patterns/patterns-library.md`

3. **Test the pattern** (10 mins)
    - Apply pattern in one place
    - Verify it works

## ðŸŽ¯ Tomorrow's Checklist

-   [ ] Create folder structure (1 min)
-   [ ] Copy anchor document template (2 mins)
-   [ ] Copy patterns document template (2 mins)
-   [ ] Copy prompts to folders (5 mins)
-   [ ] Analyze your User domain (10 mins)
-   [ ] Create initial anchor content (10 mins)
-   [ ] Extract first pattern (10 mins)
-   [ ] Test with real feature (20 mins)

**Total: 60 minutes to full setup!**

## ðŸ’¡ Pro Tips for Tomorrow

### Tip 1: Start Small

-   Pick ONE domain (User is usually good)
-   Get it working perfectly
-   Then expand to other domains

### Tip 2: Test The Flow

Try this exact flow:

1. Write a test using `3-daily-workflow/test-first.md`
2. Generate implementation using `3-daily-workflow/implementation.md`
3. Check quality using `4-work-checkup/validate-types.md`

### Tip 3: Make It Visible

Keep these files open in VSCode:

-   Left: Your code
-   Right: Anchor document
-   Bottom: Terminal with tests

### Tip 4: Update As You Go

When you discover a new pattern:

1. Add to patterns library immediately
2. Update anchor if needed
3. Share with team

## ðŸ”¥ The Power Move

Add this to the top of EVERY file you create:

```typescript
/**
 * This file implements types from anchor/project-anchor.md
 * Uses patterns from patterns/patterns-library.md
 */
import { Core, User } from '@/anchor/types'; // Setup path alias
```

## ðŸ“Š Success Metrics

After 1 week, you should see:

-   âœ… No more "any" types
-   âœ… Consistent patterns across codebase
-   âœ… Tests write themselves
-   âœ… Implementations match tests perfectly
-   âœ… 5-10x productivity boost

## ðŸ†˜ Troubleshooting

**Problem**: Copilot not using anchor types
**Fix**: Add explicit reference in comment

```typescript
// Implement UserService from anchor/project-anchor.md#user-domain
```

**Problem**: Generated code doesn't match patterns
**Fix**: Reference specific pattern

```typescript
// Use BaseRepository pattern from patterns/patterns-library.md#repository-patterns
```

**Problem**: Too much to setup
**Fix**: Just do User domain today, expand tomorrow

## ðŸŽ‰ You're Ready!

Tomorrow morning:

1. Run the setup script
2. Copy the documents
3. Start with User domain
4. Watch your productivity soar!

Remember: The goal is to prevent bad code by constraining Copilot with your types and patterns. This setup ensures every line generated is high quality!
