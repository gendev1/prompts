# Check Patterns Prompts

## 1. Pattern Compliance Check

/\*\*

-   Verify this code follows patterns from patterns-library.md:
-
-   Check:
-   1. ✓ Repository extends BaseRepository
-   2. ✓ Service extends BaseService
-   3. ✓ Error handling matches pattern
-   4. ✓ API responses match pattern
-   5. ✓ Testing follows patterns
-
-   Suggest refactoring for non-compliance
    \*/

## 2. Anti-Pattern Detection

/\*\*

-   Find anti-patterns in this code:
-
-   Look for:
-   1. ❌ Direct database access in services
-   2. ❌ Business logic in controllers
-   3. ❌ Missing error handling
-   4. ❌ Synchronous operations that should be async
-   5. ❌ Tight coupling
-   6. ❌ Missing dependency injection
-
-   Suggest fixes using established patterns
    \*/

## 3. Pattern Opportunities

/\*\*

-   Identify where patterns could improve this code:
-
-   Look for:
-   1. Repeated code that could use a pattern
-   2. Complex logic that could be simplified
-   3. Missing abstractions
-   4. Hard-coded values
-   5. Missing caching opportunities
-
